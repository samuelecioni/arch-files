# The best way to store your dotfiles: A bare Git repository

Disclaimer: the title is slightly hyperbolic, there are other proven solutions to the problem. I do think the technique below is very elegant though.

Recently I read about this amazing technique in an [Hacker News thread][1] on people's solutions to store their [dotfiles][2]. User `StreakyCobra` [showed his elegant setup][3] and ... It made so much sense! I am in the process of switching my own system to the same technique. The only pre-requisite is to install [Git][4]. 

In his words the technique below requires:

> No extra tooling, no symlinks, files are tracked on a version control system, you can use different branches for different computers, you can replicate you configuration easily on new installation.

The technique consists in storing a [Git bare repository][5] in a "_side_" folder (like `$HOME/.cfg` or `$HOME/.myconfig`) using a specially crafted alias so that commands are run against that repository and not the usual `.git` local folder, which would interfere with any other Git repositories around.

## Starting from scratch

If you haven't been tracking your configurations in a Git repository before, you can start using this technique easily with these lines:
    
    
    git init --bare $HOME/.cfg
    alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
    config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
    echo "alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.bashrc

* The first line creates a folder `~/.cfg` which is a [Git bare repository][5] that will track our files.
* Then we create an alias `config` which we will use instead of the regular `git` when we want to interact with our configuration repository.
* We set a flag - local to the repository - to hide files we are not explicitly tracking yet. This is so that when you type `config status` and other commands later, files you are not interested in tracking will not show up as `untracked`.
* Also you can add the alias definition by hand to your `.bashrc` or use the the fourth line provided for convenience.

I packaged the above lines into a [snippet][6] up on Bitbucket and linked it from a short-url. So that you can set things up with:
    
    
    curl -Lks http://bit.do/cfg-init | /bin/bash

After you've executed the setup any file within the `$HOME` folder can be versioned with normal commands, replacing `git` with your newly created `config` alias, like:
    
    
    config status
    config add .vimrc
    config commit -m "Add vimrc"
    config add .bashrc
    config commit -m "Add bashrc"
    config push

## Install your dotfiles onto a new system (or migrate to this setup)

If you already store your configuration/dotfiles in a [Git repository][4], on a new system you can migrate to this setup with the following steps:

* Prior to the installation make sure you have committed the alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zsh`:
    
        alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'

* And that your source repository ignores the folder where you'll clone it, so that you don't create weird recursion problems:
    
        echo ".cfg" >> .gitignore

* Now clone your dotfiles into a [bare][5] repository in a _"dot"_ folder of your `$HOME`:
    
        git clone --bare  $HOME/.cfg

* Define the alias in the current shell scope:
    
        alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'

* Checkout the actual content from the bare repository to your `$HOME`:
    
        config checkout

* The step above might fail with a message like:
    
        error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
        .bashrc
        .gitignore
    Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.
    Aborting

This is because your `$HOME` folder might already have some stock configuration files which would be overwritten by Git. The solution is simple: back up the files if you care about them, remove them if you don't care. I provide you with a possible rough shortcut to move all the offending files automatically to a backup folder:
    
        mkdir -p .config-backup && 
    config checkout 2>&1 | egrep "s+." | awk {'print $1'} | 
    xargs -I{} mv {} .config-backup/{}

* Re-run the check out if you had problems:
    
        config checkout

* Set the flag `showUntrackedFiles` to `no` on this specific (local) repository:
    
        config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

* You're done, from now on you can now type `config` commands to add and update your dotfiles:
    
        config status
    config add .vimrc
    config commit -m "Add vimrc"
    config add .bashrc
    config commit -m "Add bashrc"
    config push

Again as a shortcut not to have to remember all these steps on any new machine you want to setup, you can create a simple script, [store it as Bitbucket snippet][7] like I did, [create a short url][8] for it and call it like this:
    
    
    curl -Lks http://bit.do/cfg-install | /bin/bash

For completeness this is what I ended up with (tested on many freshly minted [Alpine Linux][9] containers to test it out):
    
    
    git clone --bare https://bitbucket.org/durdn/cfg.git $HOME/.cfg
    function config {
       /usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME $@
    }
    mkdir -p .config-backup
    config checkout
    if [ $? = 0 ]; then
      echo "Checked out config.";
      else
        echo "Backing up pre-existing dot files.";
        config checkout 2>&1 | egrep "s+." | awk {'print $1'} | xargs -I{} mv {} .config-backup/{}
    fi;
    config checkout
    config config status.showUntrackedFiles no

## Wrapping up

I hope you find this technique useful to track your configuration. If you're curious, [my dotfiles live here][10]. Also please do stay connected by following [@durdn][11] or my awesome team at [@atlassiandev][12].
